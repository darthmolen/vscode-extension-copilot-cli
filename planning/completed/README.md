# Completed Planning Documents

This directory contains planning documents for features that have been **implemented and tested**.

## Purpose

- Historical record of why decisions were made
- Reference for understanding existing features
- Examples for creating new planning documents
- Context for future enhancements

## Contents

Documents here represent completed work. They should not be modified unless adding post-implementation notes or lessons learned.

## Moving Documents Here

When you complete a feature:
1. Ensure all tasks are checked off
2. Add "Implementation Complete" section with:
   - Date completed
   - Test results
   - Any deviations from original plan
   - Lessons learned
3. Move from `../planning/` to `completed/`

## Example

See `PLAN-ACCEPTANCE-TEST-STRATEGY.md` for a complete example.
