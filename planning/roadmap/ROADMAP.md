# Roadmap

This is where we capture ideas for future implementation.

## 3.X

* Mid-session model switching.
* MCP UI.
* Multi-session support (for workflows like ACE-FCA).
* Copy and paste images directly into the chat.
* Show images from the AI in chat.
* Slash command IntelliSense / auto-complete.
* Show when a message is queued, awaiting AI notice.
* Multiple Agents - separate virtual windows (a tmux-like experience)
* User hook support (users can define their own pre and post hooks)
