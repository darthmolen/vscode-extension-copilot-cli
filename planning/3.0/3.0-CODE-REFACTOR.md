# vscode-extension-copilot-cli 3.0 architecture plan

## Goals

- **Clarify boundaries** between extension host (backend) and webview (frontend).
- **Modularize UI** so it can evolve independently (e.g., MCP UI, new panels).
- **Stabilize messaging** with a typed RPC layer.
- **Prepare for 3.0 features** like MCP UI and richer agent workflows.

## High-level architecture

### Extension host (backend)

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Register VS Code commands.
  - Manage sessions and state related to:
    - Copilot CLI server mode.
    - Copilot SDK agent runtime.
    - Plan mode.
    - Tool permissions.
  - Perform workspace operations (read/write files, apply edits).
  - Handle all communication with:
    - Copilot CLI.
    - Copilot SDK.
    - MCP servers.
  - Expose a clean RPC surface to the webview.

- **Non-responsibilities:**
  - No rendering logic.
  - No UI layout decisions.
  - No direct user interaction beyond commands and notifications.

### Webview (frontend)

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Render chat UI, diffs, plan mode, and (later) MCP UI.
  - Maintain all UI state:
    - Active session.
    - Message history.
    - Streaming deltas.
    - Inline diffs.
    - Plan mode state.
    - Tool execution logs.
  - Send user intents to the backend via typed messages.
  - Decide how to visually represent backend events.

- **Non-responsibilities:**
  - No direct filesystem access.
  - No direct Copilot SDK or CLI calls.
  - No business logic beyond UI behavior.
