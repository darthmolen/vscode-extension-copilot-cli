# Planning Directory

This directory contains **active planning work** - documents for features and improvements currently being designed or implemented.

## Usage

- Place new planning documents here when starting work on a feature
- Keep task checkboxes updated as you progress
- Include problem statement, approach, and implementation tasks
- Move to `completed/` when implementation is done and tested

## Lifecycle

```
planning/                  ← You are here
  ↓ Feature implemented
  in-progress/                ← when started, files and status files go here
  completed/                 ← Move here when done
  ↓ Future work identified
  backlog/                   ← Ideas for later
```

## Template

When creating a new planning document, include:

1. **Problem Statement**: What needs to be done and why
2. **Current State Analysis**: What exists today
3. **Proposed Approach**: How we'll solve it
4. **Implementation Tasks**: Step-by-step checklist with [ ] checkboxes
5. **Technical Considerations**: Edge cases, risks, dependencies
6. **Success Criteria**: How we'll know it's complete

See `completed/` for examples.
